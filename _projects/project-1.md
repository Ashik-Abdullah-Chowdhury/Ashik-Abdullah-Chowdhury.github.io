## Description  
This project contains a comparative analysis of supervised and unsupervised classification methods. It includes a JavaScript code file for data processing or interaction, visual representations (PNGs) showcasing the results of both supervised and unsupervised classification, and a comprehensive PDF report detailing the methodology, findings, and comparison between the two classification approaches.  
## Features  
**Google Earth Engine (GEE) Script:** Implementation of classification algorithms within the GEE platform.[Click here to see the GEE Script](https://code.earthengine.google.com/671babd8a5f55227fd010a01163ec13a)   
**Supervised Classification:** Application of a specific supervised learning method for land cover mapping/analysis.[Click here to see the map](https://github.com/Ashik-Abdullah-Chowdhury/Ashik-Abdullah-Chowdhury.github.io/blob/master/_projects/supervised_boalkhali.png)  
**Unsupervised Classification:** Application of an unsupervised learning method for identifying natural groupings in geospatial data.[Click here to see the map](https://github.com/Ashik-Abdullah-Chowdhury/Ashik-Abdullah-Chowdhury.github.io/blob/master/_projects/unsupervised_boalkhali.png)   
**Comparative Analysis:** Direct comparison of the performance and outputs of supervised vs. unsupervised classification.    
**Detailed Report:** A comprehensive PDF report outlining methodology, findings, and conclusions.[Click here to see the pdf](https://github.com/Ashik-Abdullah-Chowdhury/Ashik-Abdullah-Chowdhury.github.io/blob/master/_projects/supervised_vs_unsupervised2.pdf)
