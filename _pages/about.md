## **Student Life**  
I am a student of the University of Chittagong, currently in the final stage of my B.Sc. (Hons) in Forestry and Environmental Science at the Institute of Forestry and Environmental Sciences. My undergraduate journey has been shaped by a combination of coursework, field activities, and hands-on academic experiences that helped me build a strong foundation in forestry, environmental science, and geospatial analysis. As I approach the end of my degree, I continue to engage deeply with research, collaborative projects, and practical learning that connect classroom knowledge with real-world environmental challenges.

During my undergraduate years, I tried to build a strong foundation in ecology, conservation, and environmental assessment, while gradually discovering my passion for **remote sensing and GIS**. Fieldwork and coursework helped me understand landscapes through spatial data and analytical tools, and I became deeply interested in how environmental changes can be measured and visualized.

Outside the classroom, I remained active in community and volunteer work, including plantation programs, cleanup initiatives, and leadership roles in groups like **BNCC** and the **LEO Club of Chattogram City**. These experiences strengthened my discipline, teamwork, and commitment to environmental stewardship.

## **My Interest in Research**  
As I progressed in my studies, I became increasingly drawn to the analytical side especially using satellite data to interpret real-world ecological changes. This led to a strong interest in **remote sensing, GIS, and geospatial modeling**.

I began working extensively with tools like **Google Earth Engine**, QGIS, and InVEST, discovering how geospatial analysis can answer complex environmental questions. My research now focuses on land-use dynamics, habitat quality, and environmental pressures in Bangladesh.

Currently, I am conducting research on **Suitability assessment of reservoirs in Halda Watershed**, using geospatial data to discover the suitable reservoirs which can supply water to agricultural fields.

## **My Skills**  
Over time, I am trying to develop a strong set of technical and analytical skills centered around geospatial tools and environmental data analysis. I work confidently with **Google Earth Engine**, QGIS, and InVEST for land-use classification, habitat modeling, and environmental change detection. I also write scripts in **JavaScript for GEE** and am gradually expanding my skills in **Python** for statistical analysis.

In addition to geospatial proficiency, I am trying to be skilled in scientific writing, data management, and research documentation using **MS Office, SPSS, and Zotero**. Through specialized trainings—such as satellite-based flood mapping and big-data analysis for water applications—I am gaining the ability to approach environmental problems from technical, analytical, and ecological perspectives.

These skills allow me to combine environmental understanding with modern geospatial methods to produce meaningful, data-driven insights.




<!-- A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured Markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various Markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your Markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over - just be sure to save the Markdown files! You can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

For those users that need more advanced functionality, the template also supports the following popular tools:
- [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for mathematical equations
- [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) for diagraming
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/) for plotting

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one Markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a Markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each Markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual Markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the Markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and Markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
